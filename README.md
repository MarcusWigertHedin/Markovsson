# Markovsson
General Markov chain generation playground.

Focus on exploring the possibilities of simple Markov chain-based generation mechanisms, with a focus on Swedish language things.

Note: the exported json model of Swedish words needs a bit of mangling to provide legible output, like clearing spaces and ending period. Yes this is due to me horribly mangling the markovify.Text when I should've learned how to properly use markovify.Chain.
